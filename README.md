An assembler written in Ink

# Ideas and brainstorming

Goal

- Learn about compiler backends/assemblers

Design & requirements

- Start from implementation bottom-up. Write an Ink program that writes an ELF binary, and we can build towards a compiler (maybe for Ink itself) iteratively starting from something that works.
- ELF file format guide: https://linuxhint.com/understanding_elf_file_format/
